# MGT Suite Product Roadmap

_Last updated: 2026-02-27_

---

## Phase 1 — Cloud Install (CURRENT PRIORITY)

Get new users running without needing to set up a local gateway.

- Cloud-hosted gateway option (no local setup required)
- One-click onboarding wizard
- Works on any device, no technical knowledge needed

---

## Phase 2 — Free Tier / Growth Engine

**"ChatGPT but connected to your life"**

### The Hook

Free plan gives users:

- Clean chat UI (ChatGPT-like, no friction)
- Unlimited context + persistent memory across sessions
- Connect their apps/services (GitHub, Notion, Vercel, etc.)
- Multi-agent missions (basic)

### Free vs Paid

| Feature              | Free          | Pro       |
| -------------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Chat (GPT-like)      | ✅            | ✅        |
| Persistent memory    | ✅            | ✅        |
| App integrations     | Limited (2-3) | Unlimited |
| Local model support  | ❌            | ✅        |
| Multi-agent missions | Basic         | Full      |
| Goal-guided sessions | ❌            | ✅        |
| Custom agents        | ❌            | ✅        |

### Marketing Angle

> "ChatGPT with access to your apps, services, unlimited context, and memory that actually helps you finish things."

## Phase 3 — Goal-Guided Sessions ("OpenClaw for Dummies")

**For non-technical users who want AI to guide them, not just answer them.**

### Core Concept

When a user starts a new session, they set a goal. The app:

1. Picks the best model for that goal automatically
2. Guides them through decisions with choice cards instead of a blank prompt box
3. Handles compaction silently — saves progress, resumes next session
4. Walks them toward completion step by step

### Model Routing by Goal

- 🔬 Research → best context window model
- 🌐 Build something → best coder model
- ✍️ Write/create → best creative model
- 📊 Analyze → best reasoning model
- 💬 Just chat → balanced/fast model

### Decision Cards (key UX innovation)

Instead of overwhelming users with a blank prompt, the AI surfaces structured choices at the right moment:

> "You want to build a website. First, pick a host:"
> **[Vercel]** **[Netlify]** **[Self-host]** **[Help me decide]**

Then guides them through each step — domain, framework, deployment — all via conversation + guided cards.

### Compaction for Dummies

- Before context limit: auto-saves goal + progress as handoff
- Next session auto-loads: "Welcome back — you were building X, last step was Y. Continue?"
- User never loses work or context

### Why This Beats ChatGPT

| ChatGPT                    | MGT Suite Goal Mode                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Blank box, figure it out   | Goal-first, app guides you           |
| One model, always          | Best model auto-selected per task    |
| Context dies silently      | Compaction handled, progress saved   |
| No memory between sessions | Full persistent memory               |
| No multi-agent             | Spawn specialists mid-session        |
| No app integrations        | Connect GitHub, Vercel, Notion, etc. |

### Tagline

> "Set a goal. MGT Suite picks the best AI, walks you through every decision, and never forgets where you left off."

## Cloud Infrastructure R&D (2026-02-27)

### Decision: Coolify + Hetzner

- **Hosting:** Hetzner VPS (CX32 ~€9/mo handles 50-200 users)
- **Orchestration:** Coolify (open source PaaS, has REST API for programmatic deploys)
- **Routing:** Traefik (built into Coolify) + wildcard SSL via Cloudflare DNS challenge
- **Subdomain pattern:** `user123.gateway.mgtsuite.app` per user
- **Auth:** Simple signup API → calls Coolify API → spins gateway container → returns URL
- **Sizing:** 0-50 users CX22 (€4), 50-200 CX32 (€9), 200-500 CAX41 (€19)
- **Also look at:** Elestio (managed hosting for OSS apps, could shortcut provisioning infra)

### UX Pattern ("magic install")

- No terminal ever for cloud users
- Signup → paste API key → auto-connects → land in chat UI
- Behind the scenes: gateway container auto-provisioned via Coolify API
- Same pattern as n8n Cloud, Flowise Cloud, AnythingLLM Cloud

### Desktop + Mobile App Distribution

- **Tauri v2** already configured: dmg (Mac), nsis (Windows), appimage (Linux)
- **CI/CD:** `.github/workflows/release.yml` — push tag → builds all platforms → GitHub Release
- **Identifier:** `io.buildingthefuture.mgtsuite`
- **Missing for cloud:** CSP needs `connect-src` updated to allow cloud gateway URLs (not just localhost)
- **iOS/Android:** Tauri Mobile (beta) — needs `tauri-plugin-mobile`, separate build targets
- **App Stores:** Mac App Store needs Apple signing certs + notarization. Windows needs code signing cert. iOS needs Apple Dev account ($99/yr). Android needs Google Play ($25 one-time).
- **Auto-update:** Tauri updater plugin — point at GitHub Releases, signs updates with existing TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY

### Next Steps (Cloud MVP)

1. Hetzner CX32 + Coolify install
2. Wildcard DNS `*.gateway.mgtsuite.app` → Hetzner IP
3. Verify OpenClaw gateway runs headless in Docker
4. Simple provisioning API (Node/Bun)
5. MGT Suite onboarding: "Connect to cloud" flow
6. Update CSP to allow cloud URLs
7. Desktop: update release workflow with proper signing
8. Mobile: scope Tauri Mobile vs PWA vs separate React Native app
